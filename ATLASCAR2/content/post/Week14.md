In these past few weeks I started doing the state of the art, I also created the index for the thesis and a table to summarize the type of sensors most of autonomous vehicles usually have.

In the other hand, I tested the cameras in rviz that had a little problem based on the pc using the ubuntu 20.04.

I'm trying to create a Gantt Chart to organize my days based on what I need to do.
