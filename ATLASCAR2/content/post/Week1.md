For the first task in this project, I was asked to organize and label the cables of the ATLASCAR2. The objective of this task was to 
understand the electric connections of the car, which were very mangled and hard to decipher.

Here's a picture to exemplify the state of the car:

After some time in that jungle of wires, I made my way to the end. With time, the final result can be even better.
