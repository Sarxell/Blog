For the first task in this project, I was asked to organize and label the cables of the ATLASCAR2. The objective of this task was to 
understand the electric connections of the car, which were very mangled and hard to decipher.

Here's a picture to exemplify the state of the car:

After some time in that jungle of wires, I made my way to the end. The final result could be better ( if the camera inside 
the car isn't being used, it could make things more clear taking it off) but it's nt bad 
for the first time arranging the car.
